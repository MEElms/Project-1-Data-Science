This chart shows the percentage of males, females, non-binary and no identity individuals in the four IT Classes.

Males dominated every class with women and non-binary making up the minority. This information can be useful to allow better representation of minority groups in the IT World!

######* What events/activities had the most and least participants?

This chart depicts how many people who took the survey went to certain event prior to attending County College of Morris.

The most popular event was Individual Campus visits at **31.65%** and the least popular was the Corporation Training Event at **0.46%**.

#### Insights

The information above can be utilized to cancel unnescessary events and bulster the most popular ones. As well as improve diversity among the students within the IT department, hopefully branching to the IT space as a whole.
